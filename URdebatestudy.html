<div style="width:850px; margin:0 auto; margin-top:30px;">
<h2> <font size = "80%"> Have you ever wondered whether you speak too fast, too softly, or fail to make eye contact? </font> </h2>


<p style="font-size:120%;"> Through our research study, you have the opportunity to have your debate recorded, so that you can review your videos on how to improve, and we can review your videos to identify features of effective speaking. </p>

<p style="font-size:120%;"> If you are interested in participation, your debate will be recorded from the back of the room with your consent. A few weeks after the competition, your video recordings will be made available only to you and our research team. </p>

<p style="font-size:70%;"> This study is being conducted by the Rochester Human Computer Interaction Lab at University of Rochester and NAUDC 2019 at Hobart and Willams Smith Colleges</p>

<h1> <font size = "6"> How Will Your Data Be Analyzed </font> </h1>
<p align= "left" style="font-size:120%; "> Our research team will analyze the videos with computer vision software. For example, we will look at whether the frequency of smiling is associated more or less with winning debate speeches. </p>
<p style="font-size:120%;"> Ultimately, we hope to develop a computer program which will be able to predict the effectiveness of a given speech and provide individuals with useful feedback on how they can improve their speaking skills. </p>

<h1> <font size = "6"> How The Study Will Run: </font> </h1>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:120%;"> You will be given one of these yellow sticker to indicate to the camera person that you have given your consent to be recorded. </li> 

<img src = "researchpic.jpeg" alt = "research.com" width = "124" height = "142" >


<li style="font-size:120%;">Your debate speeches will then be recorded with a video camera.</li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">You will complete a short questionnaire after your debate.</li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">We will collect your debate scores from the public postings</li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">You will be paid $5 for each round you give us permission to analyze in the form of an Amazon gift card.</li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">We take your consent and privacy very seriously. As this study has received Institutional review Review Board approval and these protocols will be strictly followed. </li>
<li style="font-size:120%;">At the end of any of the debate rounds, or at the end of the competition, you can change your mind and we will delete the video recording immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h1> <font size = "6"> How Your Data Will be Stored </font> </h1>

<p style="font-size:120%;">The video and audio recordings from this research study will be stored and used by our research team to develop computer models of effective speaking.</p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">In addition, anonymized numerical data extracted from the videos will become part of a public database. Numerical data extracted will include things such as the intensity of your facial expressions and volume modulation among others. In addition, your name or other personally identifying features will not be associated with the public database in any way. The database will be made available to research institutions on approval of requests.<b> Note that your actual videos will not be a part of this database.</b> </p>

<p style="font-size:120%;">If you don’t want to take part in this study and don’t want to be recorded, you don’t need to do anything. If you are interested, please use our online registration process to register or stop by our registration desk outside to pick up a packet and a participation pin. </p>
