			<h3>Have you ever wondered whether you speak too fast, too softly, or fail to make eye contact?</h3>

			<h5>Through our research study, you have the opportunity to have your debate recorded, so that you can review your videos on how to improve, and we can review your videos to identify features of effective speaking.</h5>
			
			<h5>If you are interested in participation, your debate will be recorded from the back of the room with your consent. A few weeks after the competition, your video recordings will be made available only to you and our research team.</h5>

			<p>This study is being conducted by the Rochester Human Computer Interaction Lab at University of Rochester and NAUDC 2019 at Hobart and Willams Smith Colleges</p>
